Making a synapse gene ontology.

StringDB
---
To collect the synapse network from StringDB we...After that we gather a list of 
disease genes from the OMIM database + those genes given to us and extract the 
first neighbors. 

Running the CliXo Pipeline
---
Once the network was build we ran clixo <network file> <alpha> <beta>

1) Run the StringDB extraction script.  
2) Open and execute Run_Clixo.ipynb (update Clixo path if necessary). 
3) Visualize the new ontology.
