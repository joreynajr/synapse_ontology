May mediate cross-talks between Ras- and Rho-regulated signaling pathways in cell growth regulation. Isoform 2 has higher GAP activity (By similarity); Belongs to the PX domain-containing GAP family
1126	PPP1R9B	9606.ENSP00000478767	PPP1R9B	Neurabin-2; Seems to act as a scaffold protein in multiple signaling pathways. Modulates excitatory synaptic transmission and dendritic spine morphology. Binds to actin filaments (F-actin) and shows cross-linking activity. Binds along the sides of the F-actin. May play an important role in linking the actin cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane at the synaptic junction. Believed to target protein phosphatase 1/PP1 to dendritic spines, which are rich in F-actin, and regulates its specificity toward ion channels and other substrates, such as AMPA-type and NMDA-type glutamate receptors.
